    "\n",
    "Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/us-smoking-trend/data. The data that I am looking to analyse is how much Australians smoke cigarettes since 1980. My goal is to compare the number of cigarettes that a male or female Australian smokes. From this data we can draw conclusions such as which gender has contributed to higher number of cigarettes smoked per year and which gender is predicted to lessen/increase as the years go on. The data is publicly available and I will access it through a .csv file. \n",

    "Non Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Usability:\n",
    "The User Interface is required to be clear and concise, with organised headings, and the appropriate text size and placement and aesthetically pleasing. The README document is required to explain essential information regarding my dataset and user interface. It is important to maximise these requirements in order to help and guide the user in order to help achieve maximum efficiency and understanding when navigating my database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability:\n",
    "The system is required to notify users of errors in the Use Cases, also suggesting to them to read the README document again. Furthermore, if there are any possible errors in the database, users will also be informed in the README document. These requirements are essential for reliability because they make sure that all data is usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research and Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Research of Chosen Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: \n",
    "The purpose of this dataset is to inform the user about Australia’s smoking trends since 1980, as well as comparing which gender contributes more. This is important because it can provide insights to the effectiveness of anti-smoking campaigns and the increased awareness of smoking side effects. Furthermore it can assist those who are concerned about reducing the smoking trends in Australia. \n",
    "Missing Data:\n",
    "It is necessary to acknowledge missing data because it is significant to the accuracy and reliability of the entire dataset. When examining the given database, I could not find any missing data, or data that was not included in the correct places. However, in order to help achieve the purpose of the User Interface, I would’ve preferred to have the death rates of people every year included in the database so that the user could identify the trends and patterns much easier. \n",
    "Stakeholders:\n",
    "The stakeholders of those who would benefit the most from the User Interface are most likely to be researchers/scientists and healthcare providers as well as public health officials and the press/media.\n",
    "Use:\n",
    "The information obtained from this data analysis can be used to understand the trends regarding cigarettes in Australia, which can furthermore support studies on the health impacts of smoking and help to make informed decisions to reduce smoking and provide better healthcare to patients. The data can also be used to help advocate and publicise the devastating long term effects of smoking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy and Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Privacy of Source:\n",
    "The source of which I am sourcing the data is publicly available to all, on a public website that anyone can access. Furthermore, the data that the source needs to protect is their personal information, such as their name, date of birth, healthcare providers and possible sickness or death. The dataset does not specify personal information, and only provides information about the raw information, which is all anonymous. \n",
    "Application of Data Privacy:\n",
    "My responsibilities in regards to data privacy is very limited because this database is already quite private with the information presented. However, my responsibility is to not distribute inaccurate information that could be proven false.\n",
    "Cyber Security:\n",
    "To maintain cyber security for a web application, these features should be implemented:\n",
    "Proper user authentication is important because it ensures that only authorised users can access the web application. Authentication or verification can include usernames and passwords, and multi factor authentication like a fingerprint scan or a second password.\n",
    "Password hashing basically just converts passwords that the user enters into a string of characters which is stored in the database. This is a precaution in case the application gets hacked. If there is a breach, password hashing stops hackers from getting your passwords. So instead of them getting your passwords they get something else.\n",
    "Encryption is converting data to a format that can only be decrypted back into normal format with a unique key. It's like scrambling data and the only way to unscramble it is by using a special key. \n",

    "Conclusions:\n",
    "Some of the conclusions that can be drawn from this data include the fact that the overall amount of people that smoked declined over the years. Another conclusion that can be drawn from this data is that there has always been more female smokers than male smokers. This type of data can help those in the medical field, as well as public health officials as they know who to target more. \n",
